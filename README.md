ID -> Const
========

Batch convert NPCs from athena / Hercules from using a view ID to constant sprite name.

How To
========

Simply drop your npc folder into the same directory as the php file and use php to run id2const.php. It will loop through all your scripts and overwrite them with the new file, which uses constants instead of the view IDs.
